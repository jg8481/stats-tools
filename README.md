# stats-tools

A set of command-line statistics tools.

**Note From [Josh](https://github.com/jg8481):** This is a work-in-progress fork of jweslley's original [stats-tools](https://github.com/jweslley/stats-tools), modified to run inside a Docker container. First install Docker Desktop and make sure you have the latest version of `docker-compose`. After both are installed you can then use the `start-generator-docker-container.sh` Bash script to build and use the following commands to run the `stats-tools` from inside a Docker container.
```
 - bash ./start-stats-generator-docker-container.sh Build-Images-Teardown-Old-Docker-Containers
 - bash ./start-stats-generator-docker-container.sh Generate-All-Stats
 - bash ./start-stats-generator-docker-container.sh Generate-Using-Specific-Utiliy std
```

## Installation

[Download](https://github.com/jweslley/stats-tools/releases) the binaries and put them somewhere in your path.


### From source

    git clone git://github.com/jweslley/stats-tools.git
    cd stats-tools
    make


## Utilities

* **min** - Calculate the minimum of a number sequence
* **max** - Calculate the maximum of a number sequence
* **mean** - Calculate the mean of a number sequence
* **std** - Calculate the standard deviation of a number sequence
* **var** - Calculate the variance of a number sequence
* **sum** - Calculate the sum of a number sequence
* **stats** - Output a summary table including mean, median, mininum, maximum, standard deviation, variance and number count of a number sequence


## Usage

All utilities take as input a file in table format to perform some calculation based on it. A tipical input file is shown below:

    1 2 4
    3 5 4
    6 4 6
    4 5 6
    9 12 16

Considering this input file, let's call it `example1.dat`, you can calculate some statistics like:

The `max` value on the first column:

    max example1.dat

The `min` value on the second column:

    min -c 2 example1.dat


If the input file's columns are separated by another character instead of whitespace characters, like CSV files, you can use the `-s` option to denote this. The next example outputs a statistical `summary` about the second column of the following file (`example2.dat`):

    "A",10,12
    "A",11,14
    "B",5,8
    "B",6,10
    "A",10.5,13
    "B",7,11

Calculating the summary:

    stats -c 2 -s , example2.dat

Commonly, data files may contain a head, i.e., the first line describes the columns, something like the `example3.dat` file showed below:

    Year,Make,Model,Description,Price
    1997,Ford,E350,"ac abs moon",3000.00
    1999,Chevy,"Venture ""Extended Edition""","",4900.00
    1999,Chevy,"Venture ""Extended Edition, Very Large""","",5000.00
    1996,Jeep,Grand Cherokee,"MUST SELL!air, moon roof, loaded",4799.00

The `-b` option remove the first line from calculations. In this case, the mean price of the cars is given by:

    mean -b -s, -c5 test/example3.dat


### Piping data

All `stats-tools` read data from standard input if no file is passed to them. The following command calculates the max value on the second column containing the word `bar` in the file `foo.dat`:

    grep bar foo.dat | max -c 2
